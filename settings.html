Because I have to: </br><h1><font color="RED">
"NOT AFFILIATED WITH OR APPROVED BY IMGUR"
</font></h1></br>
That's right. </br>
I did this all for you guys, and Sarah, because I wanted you guys to stop bothering Sarah about 1 stupid thing. </br>
Seriously, she somehow manages to manage you guys, and, in return, she's bothered about MORE things you guys want her to do.It's a bit crazy. 
I'm sure you all love her, but you're also quite smothering at times.</br>
(Every time I see those posts saying "look at these small little websites that do cool things" I know those websites are going to be dead for the next week.)</br></br>
Either way: go tell her how much you appreciate her, even though she refuses to replace the loading icon again <a href="http://imgur.com/user/sarah">@SARAAAA</a><a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/jTWiyra">AAAAAH</a>.</br>

(Yes, I know my HTML sucks, and this page is an eyesore. it does what it needs to. that's it) </br>
<font size="1"> but... y'know, if you like what I do, and want to thank me with a little moneytary payment (considering I did lose money creating this) here's a little tip jar: </br></font>

<!-- Oh no! I have to identify what I do with my GRAND income if this button generates more than $10,000. I don't expect to get much, hopefully enough to cover costs.
	I didn't encrypt the button so A) I could mess with it, and B) it's going to be a local file, if you edit it, the only one you're hurting is yourself. -->
